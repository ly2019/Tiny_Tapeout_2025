## How it works

Three signals being on within the same time frame (6s with 100 MHz) triggers an alarm output

## How to test

Connect inputs with external inputs (say three sensors, three buttons, etc.) and output to an LED.

## External hardware

Later one needs to connect the signals input to some sensors and output to a display, LED, or sound system.
